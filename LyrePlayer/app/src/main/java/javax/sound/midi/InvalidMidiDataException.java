 * An {@code InvalidMidiDataException} indicates that inappropriate MIDI data
 * was encountered. This often means that the data is invalid in and of itself,
 * from the perspective of the MIDI specification. An example would be an
 * undefined status byte. However, the exception might simply mean that the data
 * was invalid in the context it was used, or that the object to which the data
 * was given was unable to parse or use it. For example, a file reader might not
 * be able to parse a Type 2 MIDI file, even though that format is defined in
 * the MIDI specification.
